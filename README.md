## Configuring the database

( Upgade to MySQL 8.0 if you are using lower versions )

1. Create new mysql user for sef
    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'sef'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'sef123';
    ```
2. Grant access to the new user
    ```sql
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'sef'@'localhost';
    ```
3. Run the mysql.sql script in scripts directory to import the database.
    ```
    mysql> source scripts\mysql.sql;
    ```

## Building the project

1. Replace the respective properties in the application.properties file
    ```
     vim src/main/resources/application.properties  
    ```
   - `${DB_NAME}` - Database name + ?useSSL=false
   - `${DB_URL}` - 127.0.0.1:3306
   - `${DB_USERNAME}` - Database name 
   - `${DB_PASSWORD}` - Database name 

1. Add a random String as the webhook key in configprops.properties file
   ```
     vim src/main/resources/configprops.properties  
   ```
    replace `${WEBHOOK_KEY}` key with your random string. 
2. Build the project using maven
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```
3. Run the generated jar file
    ```
     java -jar target/sef-github-leaderboard-1.5.9.RELEASE.jar
    ```
4. Access the UI by visiting `http://localhost:9090/`

## Setting up the webhook

Now that our webhook is ready to deliver messages.   

Recall that we specifically set our webhook URL to `http://localhost:8080/api/github-leaderboad/v1/webhook/{YOUR_KEY}`. 
Since we're developing locally, we'll need to expose our local development environment to the Internet, so that GitHub 
can send out messages, and our local server can process them.

### Using ngrok

First, we'll install a program to expose our local host to the Internet. We'll use ngrok to do this. 
[ngrok is a free download](https://ngrok.com/download) available for all major operating systems.

When you're done with that, you can expose your localhost by running `./ngrok http 8080` on the command line. 
You should see a line that looks something like this:
```
Forwarding    http://7e9ea9dc.ngrok.io -> 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Copy that funky `*.ngrok.io` URL! We're now going to go back to the Payload URL and pasting this server into that field. 
It should look something like `http://7e9ea9dc.ngrok.io/api/github-leaderboad/v1/webhook/{YOUR_KEY}`. It is our webhook 
URL.

By doing this, we've set ourselves up to expose our `localhost` at path `/api/github-leaderboad/v1/webhook/{YOUR_KEY}` 
to the Internet.

### Adding webhook to github

To set up a webhook, go to the settings page of your repository or organization. From there, click Webhooks, 
then Add webhook.

`Payload URL` - Our Webhook url

`Content type` - `application/json`

`Which events would you.. webhook?` - Select 'Let me select individual events.' & select `Pull requests`

Now send a pull request to your repo and merge to test.

Rejoice!!! 


##  Import dummy database

If you need to test with dummy data, you can import the the database located in the scripts directory `dummy_data.sql`
```
mysql -u user_name -p database_name < scripts/dummy_data.sql
```
